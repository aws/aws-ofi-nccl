# v1.2.0 release notes

This release requires [Libfabric v1.11.0](https://github.com/ofiwg/libfabric/releases/tag/v1.11.0)
or later and supports [NCCL v2.12.7](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nccl/releases/tag/v2.12.7-1) while
maintaining backward compatibility with older NCCL versions (up to [NCCL v2.4.8](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nccl/releases/tag/v2.4.8-1)).
It was tested with Libfabric versions up to [Libfabric v1.14.0](https://github.com/ofiwg/libfabric/releases/tag/v1.14.0).

New Features:
* Add support for NCCL v2.12 with backwards compatibility to previous NCCL versions.

Bug Fixes:
* Prevent deadlock in connection establishment when using rendezvour providers.
* Enable flush operations for provider that doesn't require memory registration.
* Enable successful runs of unit-tests with flush disabled.

The plugin has been tested with following libfabric providers using unit tests
bundled in the source code:
* tcp;ofi_rxm

* psm3


# v1.1.5 release notes

This release requires [Libfabric v1.11.0](https://github.com/ofiwg/libfabric/releases/tag/v1.11.0)
or later and supports [NCCL v2.11.4](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nccl/releases/tag/v2.11.4-1) while
maintaining backward compatibility with older NCCL versions (up to [NCCL v2.4.8](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nccl/releases/tag/v2.4.8-1)).
It was tested with Libfabric versions up to [Libfabric v1.14.0](https://github.com/ofiwg/libfabric/releases/tag/v1.14.0).

New Features:
* Make use of FI_EFA_FORK_SAFE environment variable to allow Libfabric to detect when `MADV_DONTFORK`
  is not needed (#82).  This feature requires Libfabric v1.13.0 or higher.  When used with an older version
  of Libfabric, the plugin will continue to set the RDMAV_FORK_SAFE environment variable.
* Do not request FI_PROGRESS_AUTO feature when listing OFI providers; this feature is unnecessary for the plugin
  and not requesting it improves interoperability.

Bug Fixes:
* Ensure that the buffer used for flush is page aligned and allocated with `mmap` instead of `malloc`.
  This change is needed to correctly support `fork()` with `MADV_DONTFORK` (#77).
* Fix crash when used with a GDR-capable provider that does not require memory registration (#81).

Testing:
The plugin has been tested with following libfabric providers using unit tests
bundled in the source code:
* tcp;ofi_rxm
* sockets
* efa
