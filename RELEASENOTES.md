# AWS OFI NCCL Release notes

# Supported Distributions
* Amazon Linux 2
* Ubuntu 20.04 LTS and 22.04 LTS

For releases before v1.6.0, there were generally two slightly
different releases for any version, an AWS-specific release and
a general release.  With v1.6.0, we have unified the code and made the
AWS-specific parts a compile-time option.  When a feature (or entire
release) was only available in one of the two variants, we note that
in the release notes.

# v1.9.1-aws release notes
This is a bugfix release which requires [Libfabric
v1.18.0](https://github.com/ofiwg/libfabric/releases/tag/v1.18.0) or later and
supports [NCCL 2.21.5-1](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nccl/releases/tag/v2.21.5-1)
while maintaining backward compatibility with older NCCL versions ([NCCL
v2.4.8](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nccl/releases/tag/v2.4.8-1) and later).

Bug Fixes:
* Fix release distribution generation to include missing headers introduced in
  v1.9.0. This fixes issue #382.
* Restrict libcuda link-time dependency to builds with testing enabled
* Build fixes to explicitly link against libm and libpthread used by the plugin

The plugin has been tested with following libfabric providers using tests
bundled in the source code and
[nccl-tests](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nccl-tests) suite:

# v1.9.0-aws release notes
This release requires [Libfabric v1.18.0](https://github.com/ofiwg/libfabric/releases/tag/v1.18.0)
or later and supports [NCCL 2.21.5-1](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nccl/releases/tag/v2.21.5-1)
while maintaining backward compatibility with older NCCL versions
([NCCL v2.4.8](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nccl/releases/tag/v2.4.8-1) and later).

New Features:
* Support v8 plugin interface introduced with NCCL 2.20.  This enables
  the use of the user memory registration feature recently introduced
  in NCCL.
* Update the tuner component to support v2 ext-tuner interface introduced
  with NCCL 2.21.
* Reduce ordering constraints for control messages, to reduce head of
  line blocking under congestion.

Bug Fixes:
* Increase the number of communicators to 256K (from 4K), supporting larger
  all-to-all groups.
* Improve logging in some corner case error conditions.

# v1.8.0-aws release notes
This release requires [Libfabric v1.18.0](https://github.com/ofiwg/libfabric/releases/tag/v1.18.0)
or later and supports [NCCL v2.19.4-1](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nccl/releases/tag/v2.19.4-1)
while maintaining backward compatibility with older NCCL versions
([NCCL v2.4.8](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nccl/releases/tag/v2.4.8-1) and later).

New Features:
* A tuner component for the plugin that picks the optimal NCCL algorithm and
  protocol at a given scale and message size.
* Improved communicator and memory region identifier management.
* Migrated from CUDA Runtime API to functional equivalents in CUDA Driver API in
  preparation for dma-buf support for memory registration. With this change, the
  plugin uses the same mechanism as NCCL to interact with the CUDA subsystem.
* No longer forcing a _flush_ operation for network operations when running with
  H100 GPUs, even when running with older NCCL versions (< v2.19.1).
* Improvements to internal device-agnostic APIs.
* Support for NCCL v7 ext-net plugin interface introduced in NCCL v2.19.3.
* Support for Ubuntu 22.04 LTS distribution.

Bug Fixes:
* Set the maximum NVLS tree chunk size used to 512KiB to recover from a
  performance regression introduced in NCCL v2.19.4, using a parameter
  introduced in NCCL v2.20.3.
* Prevent possible invocation of CUDA calls in libfabric by
  requiring a libfabric version of v1.18.0 or newer.
* Fix debug prints that reported incorrect device IDs during initialization
* Fixes to MAX_COMM computation.
* Better handling of NVLS enablement when NCCL is statically linked to
  applications
* Fixes to internal API return codes
* Configuration system fixes for Neuron builds
* Fixes to plugin environment parsing to be case insensitive
* Miscellaneous fixes that address memory leaks, NULL derefences, and compiler
  warnings.
* Updates and improvements to the project documentation.

Testing:
This release has been tested extensively with [NCCL
v2.19.4-1](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nccl/releases/tag/v2.19.4-1) for
functionality and performance. This release has also been lightly tested with
[NCCL v2.20.3-1](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nccl/releases/tag/v2.20.3-1) that was
released earlier this week. It was tested with Libfabric versions up to
[Libfabric v1.19.0](https://github.com/ofiwg/libfabric/releases/tag/v1.19.0).

The plugin has been tested with following libfabric providers using tests

# v1.7.4-aws release notes
This release requires [Libfabric v1.11.0](https://github.com/ofiwg/libfabric/releases/tag/v1.11.0)
or later and supports [NCCL v2.19.3-1](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nccl/releases/tag/v2.19.3-1) while
maintaining backward compatibility with older NCCL versions ([NCCL v2.4.8](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nccl/releases/tag/v2.4.8-1) and later).
It was tested with Libfabric versions up to
[Libfabric v1.19.0](https://github.com/ofiwg/libfabric/releases/tag/v1.19.0).

With NCCL 2.18.5 or later and v1.7.3-aws or later of the plugin,
[NVLink SHARP](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/upgrading-multi-gpu-interconnectivity-with-the-third-generation-nvidia-nvswitch/)
is enabled for the first time on AWS platforms.  NVLink SHARP offloads
the computation part of Allreduce collectives to the NVLink fabric,
and involves a different set of algorithms for multi-node parallelism
than previously used.  We have seen NVLink SHARP both help and hurt
performance of applications.  While NVLink SHARP is enabled by default
if NCCL 2.18.5 or later is used, users may wish to disable it by
setting `NCCL_NVLS_ENABLE=0` in the environment of your job.

New Features:
* Hard fail if GPUDirect RDMA initialization fails on an EC2 instance
  that should support GPUDirect RDMA (such as P4d.24xlarge or
  P5.48xlarge), rather than fall back to host copy buffers at
  significantly reduced performance.  Setting the environment variable
  `OFI_NCCL_DISABLE_GDR_REQUIRED_CHECK=1` will disable this behavior.
* Change the threshold at which the rdma transport switches from round
  robin to striping from 8 KiB to 256 KiB, improving the efficiency of
  large message transfers.

Bug Fixes:
* Fixed debugging output in some initialization failure cases.
* Request `FI_LOCAL_COMM` feature from Libfabric, as flush and eager
  copies are both implemented via local communication.
* Fix initialization when using the Libfabric TCP provider.
* Improve documentation on using the plugin with AWS's Elastic Fabric
  Adapter (EFA).
* Improve handling of Neuron device detection when the plugin is used
  with Tranium instances.
* Fix segfault in error case of freelist memory growth.
* The test programs that only support 2 ranks now fail with a useful
  error message if run with another number of ranks.

Testing:
The plugin has been tested with following libfabric providers using unit tests
bundled in the source code and [nccl-tests](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nccl-tests) test suite:

# v1.7.3-aws release notes
This release requires [Libfabric v1.11.0](https://github.com/ofiwg/libfabric/releases/tag/v1.11.0)
or later and supports [NCCL v2.18.5-1](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nccl/releases/tag/v2.18.3-1) while
maintaining backward compatibility with older NCCL versions ([NCCL v2.4.8](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nccl/releases/tag/v2.4.8-1) and later).
It was tested with Libfabric versions up to
[Libfabric v1.18.1](https://github.com/ofiwg/libfabric/releases/tag/v1.18.1).

With NCCL 2.18.5 and v1.7.3-aws of the plugin,
[NVLink SHARP](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/upgrading-multi-gpu-interconnectivity-with-the-third-generation-nvidia-nvswitch/)
is enabled for the first time on AWS platforms.  NVLink SHARP offloads
the computation part of Allreduce collectives to the NVLink fabric,
and involves a different set of algorithms for multi-node parallelism
than previously used.  We have seen NVLink SHARP both help and hurt
performance of applications.  While NVLink SHARP is enabled by default
if NCCL 2.18.5 or later is used, users may wish to disable it by
setting `NCCL_NVLS_ENABLE=0` in the environment of your job.

New Features:

Bug Fixes:
* Do not disable LL and LL128 protocols on P5 instances.
* Add support for g5.48xlarge instance types.
* Fix a block in use leak in the freelist implementation.

# v1.5.0 release notes

There was no general 1.5.0 release; it was limited to an AWS release.
This release requires [Libfabric v1.11.0](https://github.com/ofiwg/libfabric/releases/tag/v1.11.0)
or later and supports [NCCL v2.16.2](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nccl/releases/tag/v2.16.2-1) while
maintaining backward compatibility with older NCCL versions (up to [NCCL v2.4.8](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nccl/releases/tag/v2.4.8-1)).
It was tested with Libfabric versions up to
[Libfabric v1.16.1](https://github.com/ofiwg/libfabric/releases/tag/v1.16.1).

New Features:
* A single plugin build can now be used with multiple NCCL versions
  simultaneously (from NCCL v2.4.8 forward).  As a result, the
  `--with-nccl` argument is no longer necessary when building the
  plugin.
* Support for Tranium-based instance types.  Most users should
  continue to use the plugin that is included with the Neuron software
  stack, rather than building this plugin from scratch.
* Add support for flushing using CUDA's
  `cudaDeviceFlushGPUDirectRDMAWrites()` call rather than a read from
  the NIC.  We find the default read from the NIC to perform better
  for most situations.

Bug Fixes:
* Improve performance of small messages by removing redundant
  initialization of internal structures and redundant correctness
  checks throughout the codebase.
* Improve performance of applications with multiple active proxy
  threads.
* Improved pacing of Libfabric request completion polling, which will
  reduce stack memory utilization in many cases.
* Fix some compiler warnings.

# v1.1.5 release notes

This release requires [Libfabric v1.11.0](https://github.com/ofiwg/libfabric/releases/tag/v1.11.0)
or later and supports [NCCL v2.11.4](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nccl/releases/tag/v2.11.4-1) while
maintaining backward compatibility with older NCCL versions (up to [NCCL v2.4.8](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nccl/releases/tag/v2.4.8-1)).
It was tested with Libfabric versions up to [Libfabric v1.14.0](https://github.com/ofiwg/libfabric/releases/tag/v1.14.0).

New Features:
* Make use of FI_EFA_FORK_SAFE environment variable to allow Libfabric to detect when `MADV_DONTFORK`
  is not needed (#82).  This feature requires Libfabric v1.13.0 or higher.  When used with an older version
  of Libfabric, the plugin will continue to set the RDMAV_FORK_SAFE environment variable.
* Do not request FI_PROGRESS_AUTO feature when listing OFI providers; this feature is unnecessary for the plugin
  and not requesting it improves interoperability.

Bug Fixes:
* Ensure that the buffer used for flush is page aligned and allocated with `mmap` instead of `malloc`.
  This change is needed to correctly support `fork()` with `MADV_DONTFORK` (#77).
* Fix crash when used with a GDR-capable provider that does not require memory registration (#81).
