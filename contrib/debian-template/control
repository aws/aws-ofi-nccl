Description: NCCL libfabric plugin
 AWS OFI NCCL is a plug-in which enables EC2 developers to use libfabric as a
 network provider while running NVIDIA's NCCL based applications. Machine
 learning frameworks running on top of NVIDIA GPUs use a library called NCCL
 which provides standard collective communication routines for an arbitrary
 number of GPUs installed across single or multiple nodes. This project
 implements a plug-in which maps NCCLs connection-oriented transport APIs to
 libfabric's connection-less reliable interface. This allows NCCL applications
 to take benefit of libfabric's transport layer services like reliable message
 support and operating system bypass.
