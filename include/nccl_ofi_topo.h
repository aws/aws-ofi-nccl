/*
 * @brief 	Group libfabric NIC info structs according to locality to GPU topology nodes
 *
 * The grouping algorithm performs the following steps:
 *
 * 1. For each topology node that stores a libfabric NIC info list in its
 * user data, mark the node and its ancestors.
 * Note: Now, all marked nodes have at least one NIC info object in its
 * subtree.
 * 2. Use function `propagate_gpu_count()` to propagate GPU counts to
 * marked topology nodes: For each Nvidia GPU topology node, walk up
 * the tree and search for a marked node. If a marked node is found,
 * increase the node's 'num_groups' by one (initialized by zero).
 * 3. For each topology node with a libfabric NIC info list in its
 * user data, search towards the root for a node with 'num_groups' > 0.
 * If such a node has been found, move the list to that node.
 * If no said node is found, keep list stored in original node and set
 * `num_groups` to one.
 * 4. For each topology node with a libfabric NIC info list and 'num_groups > 0',
 * split the list into 'num_groups' sub-lists (groups) and add the
 * groups to the topology nodes corresponding to their leaders (first
 * NIC info of the list). If the length of the list is not a
 * multiple of 'num_groups', distribute the members evenly to the
 * groups with the exception that the first groups get assigned an
 * additional member.
 *
 * 
 * The example below shows a schematic representation of the topology
 * while executing the grouping algorithm. The topology shows one
 * bridge, two nodes that correspond to a Nvidia GPUs and four nodes
 * that correspond to libfabric NIC info objects.
 * Note that the schematic view below is a simplification of an actual
 * hardware topology. It is also only a selective view of a
 * hypothetical hardware topology.
 * 
 * Legend:
 * Topology nodes:
 * X:YZ
 *  |
 * 
 * Topology node type X:
 * B: Bridge
 * G: GPU
 * N: Node corresponding to a NIC
 * 
 * num_groups Y:
 * Number indicating the group count
 * 
 * Mark Z:
 * u: Unmarked node
 * m: Marked node
 * 
 * Pointer "|":
 * The symbol "|" indicates the libfabric NIC info list pointer stored in
 * the user data of the topology node. The list pointer may be NULL (no
 * list) or stores a list of info objects (NIC0, NIC1, NIC2, NIC3, NIC4).
